          <p>Hello world! My name is Paul.</p>

          <p>
            I'm currently a <b>high school student</b> and passionnate about
            <b>software development</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started programming when I was <b>10 years old</b> and I've been
            doing it ever since.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Python</b> was my first language but I quickly switched on
            <b>web developement</b> with <b>NodeJS</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was also interested by <b>making video games</b> and I've been
            doing it for like a year. But I decided to stop because I didn't
            have the time for it.

        <h2>Why?</h2>

        <div class="container">
          <p>
            I started learning programming because I wanted to make my own video
            game. I asked to my uncle's boyfriend where and how I could make a
            game and he told me to download an IDE and starting learning a
            programming language.
          </p>

          <p>He told me it will be long and difficult but he believed in me.</p>

          <p>
            I was always super inspired by him. One day, I asked him if he was
            able to unlock my computer, and without any problem he done it.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this moment I was 9 years old and very fascinated by technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now I'm following a professionnal course in electronics and network
            management, my teachers are very nice and always try to push me
            higher and higher.
          </p>

          <p>
            They believe in my capacities and don't stop felicitating me for all
            my works.
